# Note on Academic Integrity

</div>


Per the course website:
>  Cheating is when you copy, with or without modification, someone elseâ€™s work.
Unacceptable collaboration is the knowing exposure of your own exam answers, project solutions, or homework solutions. 
>
> At the same time, **we encourage students to help each other learn the course material**.
As in most courses, there is a boundary separating these two situations.
You may give or receive help on **any of the concepts covered in lecture**. You are allowed to consult with other students about the **conceptualization of a project, or the general approach for solving a problem**.

These tips intend to be just that - tips for approaching a solution, not the actual solution itself.
